<div><h3>Before you start</h3>

<div id="BYS"><p>There are probably a million websites about how to make pancakes, so thank you for choosing this recipe. This is a simple but effective recipe made from ingredients that I am sure you have at home. If you want, you can add your own ingredients like blueberries, pieces of chocolate, or whatever you want to make the pancakes taste better for you. Keep in mind that this recipe is a single portion, so if you want more, just double or triple all of the ingredient to make more. (A triple portion is enough for a family of 5 with teenage children like me. :D)</p><br></div>

<h3>ingredients: <br> <br></h3>

<ul>

<li>1 teaspoon of soda</li>

<li> 1 cup of flour</li>

<li>1/2 teaspoon of baking powder</li>

<li>1/4 teaspoon of salt</li><img style="float:right"; width="600px" src="/Users/sasha/Desktop/Screen Shot 2022-11-02 at 7.41.47 PM.png">

<li>1 tablespoon of sugar</li>

<li>1 tablespoon of butter</li>

<li>1/4 cup of milk</li>

<li>1 cup of buttermilk</li>

<li>1 egg</li>

</ul>

<h3>Step One: the dry mix</h3>

<div id="TDM"><p>For the dry mix you will need the flour, baking soda, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Get a big bowl and dump in all of the dry ingredients. Make sure to mix them very thoroughly.</p><br><br><img style="float: left"; width="400px" src="/Users/sasha/Desktop/Screen Shot 2022-11-02 at 8.01.32 PM.png"></div>


<h3>Step 2: the wet mix</h3>

<div id="TWM"><p>Get another bowl, crack in the eggs, and pour in the milk and buttermilk. Then heat up the butter and also pour it in. For better taste, you can also warm up the buttermilk because when it is cold it can make the butter clump up again.</div></p>
<br><br><br><br>

<div id="MTB"><h3>Step 4: mixing the batter</h3>
<p>Now comes the most important part: giving the batter the nice, thick texture it needs. Get the bowl containing the wet mix and pour it into the bowl with the white mix. After that get a spoon and stir the batter for about 10 - 15 stirs. This is very important! make sure not to over-mix the batter, because it will all runny and will be hard to fry. After you mix it, do not be afraid that there are random clumps of flour in the bowl. That is OK! If it really bothers you, simply let the batter wit for about 5 minutes and most of it should dissolve. Your pancakes are ready to be fried!</p><br></div>

<h3>Step 5: frying the pancakes</h3>

<p>Now that the batter is ready, it is time to fry the pancakes. Get a frying pan out, and put it on the stove. Set the fire to low, and wait for the pan to heat up. Now, wet your hands and sprinkle a few drops of water on the pan, and if they boil instantly, it means that the pan is hot enough to start frying the pancakes. Get a spoon, or any other scooping utensil you want to use, scoop up the batter, and plop it onto the frying pan. The size of the pancakes is totally up to you. This recipe is great because you do not need to add butter or oil to the frying pan before you start. The pancakes come off easily on their own. You will know when to flip the pancakes once bubbles start to appear on top. When it is time to flip the pancakes, shove a spatula under them, and simply twist your arm. When both sides of the pancake are nice and brown, pic them up again and put them on a plate. Repeat the process until there is no batter left.</p>

<h3>When you're done</h3>

<p>I hope you all have a great breakfast. Also, with your finished pancakes you can add any condiments you like to them. You can add chocolate syrup, maple syrup, berries, honey, etc. Do not forget to share this recipe with friends and family! Have a great day.</p><br><br><br><br><br>
